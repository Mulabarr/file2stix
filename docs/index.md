# file2stix Documentation

* [Inputs](inputs.md): You can upload a range of filetypes to file2stix. This section of the documentation explains the types of files you can upload and how they are processed before extraction happens.
* [Extractions / Conversion to STIX 2.1](extractions.md): file2stix extracts observables from text and translates them into STIX 2.1 Objects. This section of the documentation describes the templates of the STIX Objects created.
* [Backends](backends.md): Backends allow you to store STIX Objects in a database of your choice in addition to the local filesystem. This section of the documentation shows available backends and how to configure them.
* [Whitelists](whitelists.md): Default whitelists identify potentially benign file2stix extractions. This section of the documentation explains how default whitelists work and how write your own custom whitelists.
* [Developers](developers.md): file2stix was built to be extended. This section of the documentation covers information that will be useful to developers.
